## Site Owner Goals 
- To provide the user with a website showcasing furniture designs by Wood Wellness
- To raise brand awareness and accentuate brand identity through the use of appropriate colours imagery and text.
- To present the user with a website that is easy to navigate, fully responsive and has a clear purpose.
- To enable the user to book an appointment for consultation.
  

## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used on the Wood Wellness website is vital for the user to grasp the different designs and for the overall experience. The furniture design photos was taken on various occations in different locations. Multiple angles were shot in daylight to highlight every detail of each design. 

### Colours
The colour scheme of the site was given careful consideration to ensure they compliment the imagery and invoke a sense of calm to the user. A mixture of dark on lighter colors and vice versa, gives contrast to each section and element. To enhance the designs made from various wood species, the chosen colours were inspired by elements from nature with a metallic tone.

### Fonts
The Figtree font is the main font used throughout the whole website, and appropriately enough it's named after a tree. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The Sans Serif font is used a backup, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Fixed Bugs
- Navigation bar dropdown meny would not toggle vertically at first. In the end it was caused by a typo.
