## Site Owner Goals 
- To provide the user with a website showcasing furniture designs by Wood Wellness

- To present the user with a website that is easy to navigate, fully responsive and has a clear purpose.
- To enable the user to book an appointment for consultation.
  

## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used on the Wood Wellness website is vital for the user to grasp the different designs and for the overall experience. The furniture design photos was taken on various occations in different locations. Multiple angles were shot in daylight to highlight every detail of each design. 

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme of the site was given careful consideration to ensure they compliment the imagery and invoke a sense of calm to the user. A mixture of dark on lighter colors and vice versa, gives contrast to each section and element. To enhance the designs made from various wood species, the chosen colours were inspired by elements from nature with a metallic tone.

### Fonts
The Figtree font is the main font used throughout the whole website, and appropriately enough it's named after a tree. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The Sans Serif font is used a backup, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Links Testing

### Browser Testing
- The website underwent testing across Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari browsers without any issues detected.
    
### Device Testing
- The website was tested across multiple devices, including Desktop, Laptop, IPhone, IPad and Android devices, to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. It functioned as expected, except for one minor bug stated in [Known Bugs](#known-bugs). Additionally, its responsive design was evaluated using Chrome Developer Tools for various devices, maintaining structural consistency across all sizes.
- To further test responsiveness, I used the following websites:
  - [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://luddehs.github.io/Wood-Wellness/)
  - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fluddehs.github.io%2FWood-Wellness%2F)

### Fixed Bugs
- Initially, the navigation bar's dropdown menu failed to toggle vertically due to a typo. This issue has been corrected.
- The Philosophy section was not displaying correctly on smaller screens. By changing to a <div> element, this problem has been successfully resolved.

### Known Bugs
- Modify the column count for the Design section within media queries to eliminate empty space across various screen sizes.
